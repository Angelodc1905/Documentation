       When it comes to work and performance, desktops have the advantage and laptops can’t beat them. This is because desktops can operate at full power and can be sufficiently cooled, which offers an advantage for tasks that require a lot of power like rendering, CAD, 3D modeling, video editing, database, etc.
      </p>
      <h2>Desktop VS Laptop Gaming</h2>
      <p>When it comes to gaming, desktops are also the winners. They have better cooling systems and hardware, as well as their upgradeability. A desktop’s hardware components are full wattage while a laptop cannot use the components at its full power and manufacturers always limit the power consumption of laptop components.</p>

    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>
     The motherboard is an important computer component because it's what everything else connects to! The motherboard is a decently sized circuit board that lets other components communicate.
    </p>
    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
    <p>the power supply powers all other components of the machine. It usually plugs into the motherboard to power the other parts. The power supply connects to a plug for an outlet (on a desktop).</p>

    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>It performs the calculations needed by a system, and can vary in speed. The work that a CPU does generates heat, which is why your computer has a fan inside. A more powerful CPU is necessary for intense computer work like editing high-definition video or programming complex software.</p>

    <h2>Random-access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p>RAM is temporary memory. Whenever you open up a Microsoft Word window, your computer places it in RAM, and when you close the window, that RAM is freed.</p>

    <h2>Hard Disk Drive / Solid State Drive</h2>
    <p>Since RAM is temporary, your computer needs a place to store data permanently. That's where the hard drive comes in. The traditional hard drive consists of several spinning platters with an arm that physically writes data to the disk.</p>

    <h2>Video Card</h2>
    <p>A video card is a dedicated unit for handling the output of images to a display. Video cards have their own dedicated RAM for performing these functions.</p>
